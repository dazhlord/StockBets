# Snowflake DB Proxy API

[Try it out Here](swaggerdoc.com)

A very simple Express API that handles OAuth for the [Snowflake API](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/guide.html).

It takes in a SQL statement and returns the response. We would be able to query the Snowflake API directly if Airnode was capable of handling OAuth, which isn't available as of now.
